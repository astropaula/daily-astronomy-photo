# Inspiration & Description 
Project was prepared with help of information covered in tutorial created by Kapehe.<br>
Added animation and feature, which allows the user to toggle hide/show extra information about the photo.
This project was made mainly to practise `react` library and using `API`,<br>
learn and practise `react router` & `SAP` concept.
I also wanted to have daily dose of astronomy information for myself :)
